# Android Build Fix - MinSdkVersion Issue

## ✅ Issue Fixed!

The build error has been resolved by updating the minimum Android SDK version.

---

## 🔴 The Problem

```
Error: uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 19 cannot be smaller than version 21
       declared in library [:camera_android]
```

**Cause:** The `camera` plugin requires Android SDK 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop) or higher, but your project was configured with SDK 19 (Android 4.4 KitKat).

---

## ✅ The Solution

Updated `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
defaultConfig {
    applicationId "com.example.fake_currency_detector_trail"
    minSdkVersion 21  // ← Changed from flutter.minSdkVersion (19) to 21
    targetSdkVersion flutter.targetSdkVersion
    versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
    versionName flutterVersionName
}
```

---

## 📱 What This Means

### ✅ Your app will now:

- ✅ Build successfully on Android
- ✅ Work with the camera plugin
- ✅ Support Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and higher

### ⚠️ Note:

- Your app **will NOT run** on devices with Android 4.4 (KitKat) or older
- This is required by the camera plugin and cannot be avoided
- **98%+ of Android devices** are running Android 5.0 or higher, so this is not a significant limitation

---

## 🔧 What Was Changed

**File:** `android/app/build.gradle`

**Before:**

```gradle
minSdkVersion flutter.minSdkVersion  // This was 19
```

**After:**

```gradle
minSdkVersion 21  // Required for camera plugin
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now you can run your app:

```bash
# Clean previous build
flutter clean

# Get dependencies (already done)
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

| SDK Level | Android Version   | Support Status           |

| 23+       | 6.0+ Marshmallow+ | ✅ Fully supported       |

## 🎯 Why SDK 21 is Required

The camera plugin uses APIs that were introduced in Android 5.0:

- Camera2 API for advanced camera features
- Better permission handling
- Improved hardware access
- Modern Android features

---

## ✅ Issue Resolved!

Your app should now build and run successfully on Android devices! 🎉
